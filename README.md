Mod for Ark: Survival Ascended

This mod was created using the Ark DevKit which is an extension of the Unreal Engine 5.5 editor.  The code for this mod is Unreal Engine Blueprint scripting and the assets I created from scratch using Blender.  This mod is currently live and downloaded by many different players in the Ark community.  The released mod and gallery images can be found in the link below.
